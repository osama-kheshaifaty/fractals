# fractals

Here is a code in Python that generates the fractal image of the Mandelbrot set using the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries:

This code generates the Mandelbrot set by defining a function mandelbrot that takes in the height and width of the desired image and the maximum number of iterations. The function creates a complex grid using np.ogrid, and then iterates over the grid to determine which points belong to the Mandelbrot set. The final image is generated by plotting the results using the imshow method of the Matplotlib library.

The resulting image is a fractal, which means that it has self-similar patterns at different scales. The black regions in the image represent points in the complex plane that belong to the Mandelbrot set, while the colored regions represent points that diverge from the set after a certain number of iterations. The color of each point is determined based on the number of iterations it takes for the point to diverge.
